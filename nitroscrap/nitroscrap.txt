=What Susie (and its plugin) is=

Susie is not very popular outside of Japanese programs (list of a couple below)
but it is still a plugin format used my many more general image viewing and
manipulation programs, the plugin format also has a somewhat of a history of
use in rom hacking/game hacking/program hacking circles.

Programs that support SUSIE plugins (be warned there have been some issues with programs not totally supporting the format):

stereophotomaker:
